      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Stonegate is a unique residential community of homes, condominiums, and apartments. The focal point of the neighborhood is a 2.3-acre private country club maintained by the Stonegate Master Association. Founded in 1969, the club sits next to the 17-acre Stonegate Lake. Our amenities include six tennis courts, three swimming pools, a fitness center, a recreation field, picnic areas, and a basketball court. The 4,000 square foot clubhouse is frequently used for weddings, parties, and other special events. We are closed on Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s Day.</p>

      <p>Stonegate Country Club Membership is limited to the owners of properties that fall within the Stonegate community. Homeowners living on or west of Lake Blvd, are included in the Stonegate community, as are the owners of homes north of Tiber Avenue.</p>
        
      <p>The Stonegate Master Association is recognized by the State of California as a private, non-profit homeowners association. The seven-member Board of Directors meets monthly to review the budget, set club policies, and address member concerns. The mission of the Board is to assure affordable social and recreational opportunities for all members while protecting and enhancing their investment.</p>
        
      <p>The club employs many talented and collegial staff members that take pride in making sure members enjoy their experience on-site. Susan Towne is the club manager. The Association is professionally managed by local HOA management company, Boschken Properties, owned and operated by Kit & Steve Boschken.</p>
